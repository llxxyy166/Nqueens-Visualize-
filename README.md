# Nqueens-Visualize-
This is a iOS app visualize N-queens problem from sizz 1 to 14. Why I wrote this? No reason, just suddenly want to.

This program has bad desgin, bad UI, not creative, slow, meaningless and even the N-queens solver is only a very very 
very very very very very very very normal backtracking algorithm. BUT I JUST DO IT. 不服来打我啊呵呵
